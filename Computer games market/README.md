# Project Objective

We need to identify certain trends in game success across three regions: North America, Europe, and Japan. This will allow us to bet on potentially popular products and plan advertising campaigns. We are planning a campaign for 2017, and possibly for the more distant future. Based on the analysis, we need to identify patterns and develop principles for working with data. This will allow us to make forecasts for computer game sales, create successful marketing strategies, and provide a more accurate picture of the computer game market.

To achieve this goal, we need to create a typical user profile for each sales region. For this, we will consider the following important points:

* Determine how many games were released in different years
* Understand how sales changed across platforms
* Find out which platforms lead in sales
* Evaluate global game sales by platform
* Determine how user and critic reviews affect sales within one popular platform
* Identify the general distribution of games by genre

Also, we need to test the following hypotheses:
* The average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same
* The average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different

## Available Data

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms are available from open sources. All information is up to 2016.

## Data Description

* *Name* — game title
* *Platform* — platform
* *Year_of_Release* — release year
* *Genre* — game genre
* *NA_sales* — sales in North America (millions of copies sold)
* *EU_sales* — sales in Europe (millions of copies sold)
* *JP_sales* — sales in Japan (millions of copies sold)
* *Other_sales* — sales in other countries (millions of copies sold)
* *Critic_Score* — critics' score (maximum 100)
* *User_Score* — users' score (maximum 10)
* *Rating* — rating from the *ESRB* organization

ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) is an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, for example, "For Adults," "For Young Children," or "For Teens."

## Research Stages

* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Creating a user profile for each region
* Testing hypotheses
* General conclusion

## Research Summary

Computer game sales varied in different years. The success of implementation depends on age, genre, region, platform, user and critic ratings. The hypothesis that the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different could not be refuted. The hypothesis that the average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same could not be refuted. A more detailed report is provided in the "General Conclusion" of the analytical file.
